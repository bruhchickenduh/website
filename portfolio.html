    <h1>This game allows the user to build a snowman to their own liking by answering a set of questions. The user can customize the color, size, and accessories the snowman can have.  We used both general turtle commands and conditional statements(if and while loops) from the PLTW lessons we went over to create the game.

    <br>
    <h1>This game is based on Whack-A-Mole but with turtles. The user clicks colored labeled buttons that correspond to a colored turtle to win but their score only increases if they click the buttons when the turtles’ color are active and not black. Black colored turtles means it’s deactivated and will not count the user’s clicks. We used many list indexes and conditional statements to sort out the turtle’s colors and buttons to correspond to when the user clicks correctly. We also manipulated strings when inputting the leaderboard with the user’s name and used functions to reduce duplications.

    <h1>For this project, we used data from USDA about honey production levels across the states in America to analyze with spreadsheets. We used different graphs to separate the data to better identify relationships and patterns between the years and the honey level production with the size of the honey producers included.
